## Features

(README.md document and wikipages will publish on release of first version, please wait.)

### Locating Resources

The resource locator used in this project is a string with rich field content, separated by a colon `:`, which can
clearly describe the system, subsystem, microservice, data center, and user to which the resource belongs. It can also
express some simple resource hierarchical relationships in catalog style.

Here is an example:

> arn:activecloud-cn:ecs:cn-north-3:7611:volume/vol-8678eY3109N946oVsq
